### Backend Logic (app.py)
```python
# Lines 20-35: Market signal algorithm
if predicted_avg < last_price - threshold:
    return "Surplus", "red"
elif predicted_avg > last_price + threshold:
    return "Deficit", "green"
else:
    return "Stable", "yellow"
```

### API Response (app.py)
```python
# Lines 47-70: Full response structure
response = {
    "crop": crop,
    "location": location,
    "min_price": min_price,
    "max_price": max_price,
    "signal": signal,
    "color": color,
    "advice": advice,    # from Gemini
    "pastPrices": past_prices,
    "predictedPrices": predicted_prices
}
```

### Gemini Integration (gemini_ai.py)
```python
# Real AI-powered advice generation
def generate_farmer_advice(crop, location, signal):
    model = genai.GenerativeModel(MODEL_NAME)
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text  # Real AI output
```

### React Dashboard (App.jsx)
```jsx
// Clean component architecture
<Dashboard result={analysisResult} />
  ├── <MarketAlertCard />
  ├── <PriceRangeCard />
  ├── <PriceTrendChart />
  └── <AdviceCard />
```

## ⚠️ If Something Breaks

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check Python 3.8+
python --version

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check API key in .env
cat .env
```

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf frontend/node_modules
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### API returns error
```bash
# Check Flask is running
# Check Gemini API key is valid
# Look at Flask terminal for error messages
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Kill process on port 5000 (Flask)
# Kill process on port 3000 (React)
# Or run on different port: npm run dev -- --port 3001
```
